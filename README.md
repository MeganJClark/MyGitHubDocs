# MyGitHubDocs

These files are basically my research notes compiled while educating myself about VCS, Git and GitHub. Because
they are totally impromptu, the structure is likely to change frequently as my needs and thoughts change. 

They also intended serve as my own private help documentation that I can add to as I learn new things and reference when I forget things. If they help someone else too, good!

I use a Debian system (Ubuntu Gnome) so the instructions will naturally be more Debian specific. While I will compile instructions for other distros as I have time and curiosity, I can't guarantee any of these instructions are up to date (including the Debian distros) so when in doubt, ask Google.

In many cases the wording is my own, but sometimes the original author stated it perfectly, so I copied verbatim. Because these notes are intended
for my own usage, the verbatim quotes are not cited, but the original sources can be found in *sources.md*
